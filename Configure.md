# Compilation options

ofxImGui comes with quite a few compilation options which define how imgui is interfaced with OpenFrameworks.
By setting them explicitly, you can enforce a specific way to meet your needs.  

An easy way to get started is to call the configuration assistant (see below) and interactively explore your options.

> [!TIP]
> ** Configuration assistant**
> To have an insight on how your ofxImGui interfaces with ImGui and OpenFrameworks, you can call `gui.drawOfxImGuiDebugWindow();` together with defining `OFXIMGUI_DEBUG`.
> It contains an assistant that provides an oversight of your current configuration. It also provides some explanations and suggestions for gradually improving your configuration (to get the most out of OF+ImGui).

## Backends 

All ImGui APIs need to define a **platform and renderer backend**. The platform backend handles window initialisation and interactions with ImGui. The renderer backend handles rendering to the created surface(s). 

### GL context / Renderer backend

ofxImGui uses the native ImGui renderer backend. slightly modified version of the default 
DearImGui needs to know your GL Context. ofxImGui tries to match your project's settings.  
If your projects needs to force a specific GL configuration, you can set some native imgui compilation flags to match your project settings :
 - `IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_ES2` --> Use GLES2 (or GL ES 1.1 with some hacks).
 - `IMGUI_IMPL_OPENGL_ES3` --> Use GLES3.
 - `[none of the previous ones]` --> Use OpenGL.

### Platform Backend

By default, ofxImGui uses the official ImGui GLFW backend when using `ofAppGLFWWindow`, this ensures full compatibility with any ImGui feature, and is interfaced directly with GLFW.
The OpenFrameworks engine is customly interfaced to OF and implements minimal ImGui support. [More info](./PlatformSupport.md#backend-support-table).

Most supported OpenFrameworks build targets rely on GLFW (personal computer targets), with the exception of mobile targets (which use their respective platform windowing library), or linux builds without desktop environments (GLUT windows).

You may force to use the openframeworks backend by defining :
 - `OFXIMGUI_FORCE_OF_BACKEND` (also reffered-to as ofxImGui Legacy, the closest to JVCleave's initial release)

#### GLFW backend options

You may also override some automatic macro defines (not recommended, there are drawbacks, but it might solve some very specific use cases):

**GLFW event binding and input handling**

- `OFXIMGUI_GLFW_EVENTS_REPLACE_OF_CALLBACKS=0|1` : (Default: 1)
  Controls how the ImGui GLFW backend is bound to your `ofAppGlfwWindow` (primary viewports).
  ImGui works best when directly bound to GLFW, as OpenFrameworks strips off some data before emiting the related GLFW ofEvents.
  - `0` : Leave OpenFrameworks natively bound to GLFW, and use the ofEvent data transmitted by OpenFrameworks.
    Event propagation: `GLFW --> OpenFrameworks --> ofxImGui --> ImGui`. Input is handled by ofxImGui.
  - `1` : Bind directly to GLFW, replacing the ofApp listeners, forwarding them afterwards.
    Event propagation: `GLFW -> ofxImGui -> (ImGui + OpenFrameworks)`. Input is handled by ImGui.

This setting also affects how user input is handled.
OpenFrameworks gets its keyboard and mouse events from GLFW by default; and GLFW events can only be bound to 1 listener.
ImGui can either be bound to OpenFrameworks events, or to the native GLFW events by unbinding the OF ones.
Secondary viewports (created by ImGui) are always directly bound to ImGui.

**Multi-Context support**

The native GLFW ImGui backend doesn't support multiple contexts, which is needed for running ofxImGui in multi-window ofApps.  
It's generally recommended to **put your GUI only in 1 window if you can**.  
However, if you need multicontext support, there are two compilation options to enable support for it.
Each `ofWindow` gets one context, contexts are isolated and cannot interact together (drag & drop, move windows, etc.). 
None, one or both can be enabled simultanously, but they all require `OFXIMGUI_GLFW_EVENTS_REPLACE_OF_CALLBACKS=1`.

- `OFXIMGUI_GLFW_FIX_MULTICONTEXT_PRIMARY_VP=0|1` : (Default: 0) 
  Controls how GLFW callbacks are handled within primary viewports (`ofAppWindows`) :
  - `0` : Let ImGui forward OpenFrameworks events.  
    Event propagation: `GLFW --> ImGui --> OpenFrameworks`.
  - `1` : Let ofxImGui forward OpenFrameworks events. Enables multi-context support only for ofWindows, but not for viewport (standalone) windows.  
    Event propagation: `GLFW -> ofxImGui -> (ImGui + OpenFrameworks)`.
- `OFXIMGUI_GLFW_FIX_MULTICONTEXT_SECONDARY_VP=0|1` : (Default: 1)  
  Controls how ImGui handles GLFW callbacks within primary and secondary viewports (imgui standalone windows).  
  Applies some changes to imgui_impl_glfw to manage a `window->context` map and set the right context prior to calling ImGui API calls.  
  - `0` : Use native `imgui_impl_glfw`. No multi-context support.  
    Event propagation: `GLFW --> ImGui --> OpenFrameworks`.
  - `1` : Use modified `imgui_impl_glfw` allowing to set the correct context before dispatching GLFW callbacks.  
    This enables support for multiple contexts in both ofWindows and standalone ImGui windows.  
    Event propagation: According to `OFXIMGUI_GLFW_FIX_MULTICONTEXT_PRIMARY_VP`.

# Update GLFW 

If you use the GLFW backend (enabled by default), the [GLFW version that ships with oF or your distro](./PlatformSupport.md#Glfw-version) is probably not too recent. In order to enable more native mouse cursors, and possibly other interface polishings, you can update GLFW within your oF installation.

Only GLFW 3.4+ supports all ImGui features. Versions below gradually disable some small UI features making ImGui slightly less pretty.  
**Follow this step only if you have OF < v_0.12.1 which already ships with GLFW 3.4.**

Also note that GLFW 3.4 brings better window-resizing (no black window while resizing) to all your ofApps !

#### On Windows and MacOs

**Warning**: BigSur and above used to break glfw-updates, probably the reason why OF didn't ship with more recent versions. Proceed with caution !
````bash
# Instructions for Mac/Win
cd OF/scripts
# Only if you don't have apothecary (OF release zip):
git clone https://github.com/openframeworks/apothecary.git
# Manually edit the GLFW formula `apothecary/apothecary/apothecary/formulas/glfw.sh`, change to :
# - `VER=3.3-stable` (for gfwf 3.3.x)
# - `VER=master` (for gfwf 3.4.x, recommended)
# - `GIT_URL=https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git`
# Manually delete `apothecary/apothecary/build/glfw if it exists
# Update (change osx by vs/msys2/linux/linux64/linuxarmv6l/linuxarmv7l or remove `-t osx` for autoselect)
./apothecary/apothecary/apothecary -t osx -j 4 update glfw
# Copy ./apothecary/glfw to OF/libs/
./apothecary/apothecary/apothecary -t osx -j 4 copy glfw
# Recompile oF (github installs only, not releases)
# cd ./osx && ./compileOF.sh -j3
````  

#### On Linux

````bash
# Instructions for rpi distros and Linux desktops
# Raspbian <= Buster don't have GLFW 3.3 in their repos, but you can try.
apt update && apt upgrade libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
# Show your current version
apt-cache show libglfw3-dev
````  
_This should also enable gamepad support on RPI with Raspbian <= Buster which ships with GLFW <= 3.2.1._  
_Raspbian Note : Packages are known to be a little outdated, the easiest way is to upgrade your distro to use the latest version. At the time of OF_v0.11.0, Raspbian shipped with GLFW 3.2 for example._

Note: On Linux, your app won't run if an older GLFW version is installed on the distro.

#### After the GLFW update

Define `OFXIMGUI_GLFW_NO_VERSION_HACKS` to tell ofxImGui to force-use more precise cursors & more.
